# React Native Video App
This React Native application allows users to search and view video details, switch between light and dark themes, and navigate through different screens using React Navigation.

### Features

Responsive UI: The app has a top section showing the app's name and a main area where you can scroll through small pictures and names of videos.

YouTube API: The app gets video information from YouTube when you provide a special access code (API key).

Watching Videos: Users can see details about videos and watch them right inside the app.

Smart Loading: The app only loads videos when needed and manages information wisely to work faster.

Handling Problems: The app can deal with issues when fetching data from YouTube and tells users nicely if there's nothing to show.
